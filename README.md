## My process
Using a mobile-first approach, my goal was to recreate the figma design as closely as possible using my front-end dev knowledge. With assistance from Kevin Powell's scrimba course, I was able to recreate the design in a responsive way.

### Built with

- Responsive CSS
- HTML
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned
- Building code with a mobile-first approach
- Implementing accessibility features such as: screen reader legibility, reduced motion settings, and keyboard navigation
- Using Javascript to dynamically load content
- Referencing a Figma design to create code

### Continued development
Moving forward, my next learning goals are
- Dynamically load content using JSON and AJAX
- Investigate possible implementations using React.js
- Explore further CSS/JS transitions
